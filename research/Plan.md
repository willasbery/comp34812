# Plan

0. Research some more cool approaches and more data exploration
1. Similarity score between claim and evidence (cosine?)
2. EFL-ish - It's alread a binary clasification problem. We can invert the highly related claim evidence pairs for more training data
3. Maaaybe explore altering evidence based on specific words to make pairs more ambiguous.
4. Fine tune T5 model
5. Have a think about our second implementation
