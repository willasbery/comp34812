We should ostracise/ban abortions,"Perhaps the most prominent majority opinion was that of Dickson CJ, with Lamer J (as he then was) concurring. Dickson began by examining section 7. He found that section 251 forced some women to carry a fetus irrespective of her own ""priorities and aspirations"". This was a clear infringement of security of person. He found a further violation due to the delay created by the mandatory certification procedure which put the women at higher risk of physical harm and caused harm to their psychological integrity.   Following a standard section 7 analysis, Dickson examined whether the violation accorded with the principles of fundamental justice. He found that it did not because the excessive requirements prevented smaller hospitals from providing such services thus preventing many women from even applying for certification. Moreover, he found that the administrative system failed to provide adequate evaluation criteria which allowed the committees to grant or deny therapeutic abortions arbitrarily.   Dickson found that the violation could not be justified under section 1, focusing on the means chosen by the government to achieve its objectives. In the end, the law failed on every step of the proportionality test. First, he found the administrative process was often unfair and arbitrary. Second, the resultant impairment of the women's rights was beyond what was necessary to evaluate their case.

It would only become human because it is human already. Modern genetic science confirms this evidence, showing that from the very first moment, the program for what this living being will be is already set: an individual man with pre-determined characteristics. The adventure of human life starts at fertilization, and each of its major capabilities needs time to develop and act.' This teaching holds true and is further supported, if necessary, by recent biological science findings, which recognize that the zygote formed after fertilization already has the biological identity of a new human individual. Although no experimental data alone can prove the presence of a spiritual soul, scientific conclusions regarding human embryos provide a strong basis for recognizing a personal presence at the very start of life.
